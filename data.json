Similarly, for class 1, the negative impact of ram (-0.1918) and other features like n_cores (-0.0153) and int_memory (-0.0122) further reduced its likelihood compared to class 3. In class 0, the negative contributions from ram (-0.1731), battery_power (-0.0227), and px_width (-0.0163) also did not favor a prediction towards this class.\n\nOverall, the strong positive influence of ram, battery_power, and px_width for class 3 made it the most compelling choice for the model's prediction."
