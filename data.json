Additionally, the car buying price had a minimal positive effect.\n\nIn contrast, the \"unacceptable\" class was strongly influenced by negative contributions from seating capacity and safety rating, which significantly reduced its likelihood. These negative influences were much stronger compared to any positive influences for the \"good\" class. For the \"very good\" class, the safety rating and number of doors contributed negatively, further diminishing its likelihood compared to the \"acceptable\" class.

The Safety Rating had a particularly strong positive influence, significantly more than any other feature, while the Car Buying Price also contributed positively, albeit to a lesser extent. However, the Seating Capacity had a negative impact, but its influence was not strong enough to shift the prediction away from \"unacceptable.\"\n\nWhen we compare this with the \"acceptable\" class, the Seating Capacity did have a positive influence, but it was not as strong as the negative impact of the Safety Rating, which was a decisive factor in favoring the \"unacceptable\" prediction. For the \"good\" class, although Maintenance Cost had a slight positive influence, it was overshadowed by the negative effects of both Car Buying Price and Safety Rating, which were more aligned with the \"unacceptable\" prediction. Thus, the combination of these factors led the model to confidently predict \"unacceptable\" as the outcome."
