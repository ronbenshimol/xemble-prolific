The most influential feature that pushed the prediction towards class 0 is ram, with a significant positive contribution of +0.4343. Although battery_power had a slight negative impact of -0.0783, its effect was outweighed by the strong positive influence of ram.\n\nWhen considering class 1, battery_power showed a positive influence of +0.0440, but this was not enough to surpass the substantial impact of ram favoring class 0. Additionally, for class 3, battery_power had a positive contribution of +0.0514, yet it was overshadowed by the negative influence of ram (-0.2531) for that class. These comparisons highlight why class 0 emerged as the most probable prediction, driven primarily by the strong positive effect of ram."

Although battery_power contributed negatively (-0.0599), its impact was outweighed by the strong positive effects of ram and px_width.\n\nFor class 3, while battery_power showed a positive influence (+0.0890), it wasn't enough to overcome the stronger impact of ram favoring class 2. Additionally, px_width contributed negatively (-0.0597) for class 3, which further diminished its likelihood compared to class 2.\n\nIn contrast, class 1 had a slight positive contribution from talk_time (+0.0233), but this was not sufficient to offset the negative influence of ram (-0.1411) when compared to the strong positive ram influence for class 2. Thus, the model confidently predicts class 2 as the most probable outcome."
