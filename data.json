The most influential features that pushed the prediction towards class 2 are ram (+0.2802), battery_power (+0.0437), and px_height (+0.0300). These features collectively provided a strong positive influence, significantly outweighing any negative contributions.\n\nWhen comparing with class 0, although battery_power had a slight positive influence (+0.0120), it was not enough to counterbalance the negative impact of ram (-0.1839) and pc (-0.0069), which leaned away from class 0. Similarly, for class 1, three_g had a minor positive effect (+0.0164), but the negative influence of ram (-0.0965) and touch_screen (-0.0161) did not support class 1 as strongly as the features did for class 2.\n\nIn contrast, class 3 was not a strong contender due to the negative contributions from battery_power (-0.0475), px_height (-0.0273), and px_width (-0.0228), which did not favor class 3. Overall, the positive influences for class 2 were compelling enough to make it the predicted outcome."

The most influential feature that pushed the prediction towards class 0 is ram, with a significant positive contribution of +0.4343. Although battery_power had a slight negative impact of -0.0783, its effect was outweighed by the strong positive influence of ram.\n\nWhen considering class 1, battery_power showed a positive influence of +0.0440, but this was not enough to surpass the substantial impact of ram favoring class 0. Additionally, for class 3, battery_power had a positive contribution of +0.0514, yet it was overshadowed by the negative influence of ram (-0.2531) for that class. These comparisons highlight why class 0 emerged as the most probable prediction, driven primarily by the strong positive effect of ram."
